# testrail-plugin-demo

This example demonstrates how separately hosted 3rd party web-apps can be seamlessly integrated into TestRail.

The plugin will recreate an “Add test case” form according to your setup and allow you to create a new test case. Since this is just a proof of concept, there's no corner case handling, only primitive validation, the code is horrid, and things may break painfully.

The plugin is hosted [here (GitHub pages)](https://actinarium.github.io/testrail-plugin-demo/).  
Host UI script for TestRail can be found [here (Gist)](https://gist.github.com/Actine/e26325f93b0ff9d98029).  
GitHub repository is... well, you're looking at it.

I don't collect any data — this page communicates with nothing but your TestRail (or at least not under my governance).
